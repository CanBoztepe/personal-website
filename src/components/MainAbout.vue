    I’m a bilingual (English/Turkish) Front-End Developer with a diverse background in culinary arts
    and tech. Originally born in Australia and raised in Turkey, I studied engineering in Australia
    before pivoting to culinary school in Istanbul—an experience that honed my ability to perform
    under pressure and collaborate effectively in high-paced, team-oriented environments. I later
    transitioned into web development, learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and landed an internship
    at a startup where I was hired full-time as a Junior Front-End Developer. During that time, I
    worked closely with a senior full-stack developer to build production-ready Vue components,
    further sharpening my problem-solving and communication skills. After COVID, I leveraged my
    language abilities as a freelance translator while pursuing my Canadian visa, and I’m now based
    in Canada seeking new challenges as a Front-End Developer.
    <br /><br />
    Driven by best practices, responsiveness, and accessibility, I thrive in fast-paced startup
    settings where I can combine creativity and technical expertise to solve problems. I’m
    proficient with
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="about-link"
      >Vue</a
    >
    and always eager to learn new frameworks and tools. <br /><br />
    Outside of coding, I enjoy going for walks, hitting the gym, and make gaming videos—activities
    that help me stay balanced, curious, and solution-oriented. I look forward to contributing my
    adaptability, teamwork, and passion for continuous growth to a forward-thinking development
    team.
